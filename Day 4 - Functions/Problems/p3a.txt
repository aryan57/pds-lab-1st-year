Linear interpolation
There are two scales, S and T.
The user supplies their lower and upper limits in main().
He also gives as input a measurement in one scale and the name of that scale.
Write a function that computes the corresponding value in the other scale and returns it to main().
Print the value from main().

Example:
Enter the lower and the upper limits of S: 10 150
Enter the lower and the upper limits of T: 50 100
Enter a value and its scale: 95 S
Equivalent value in T = 80.357142
