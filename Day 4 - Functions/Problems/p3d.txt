Definite integral by trapezoidal rule.
Write a function double y(double x, int p) that takes as input the values of x and p, computes the value of

y(x) = 1 + 1/(1+x) + 1/(2+x^2) + ... + 1/(p+x^p),

and returns that value to the caller function, integral().

The function double integral(double a, double b, double n, int p) takes as input the domain [a,b] of the function y along with the values of n and p in order to compute the integral y.dx in [a,b] using trapezoidal rule.
The computed value y.dx is returned by integral() to main(), which calls it and prints the value on the terminal.

The values of a, b, and p are taken as input from the user in main(), and n is taken as 100 times the difference between a and b.
Assume that a and p are non-negative.

See trapezoidal rule in the attached p3d.pdf.

Examples:

$ ./a.out

Enter the domain limits a and b: 0 10
Enter the power p: 0
Value of the integral = 10.000000

$ ./a.out

Enter the domain limits a and b: 0 1
Enter the power p: 1
Value of the integral = 1.693153

$ ./a.out

Enter the domain limits a and b: 0 10
Enter the power p: 1
Value of the integral = 12.397904

$ ./a.out

Enter the domain limits a and b: 0 1
Enter the power p: 2
Value of the integral = 2.128361

$ ./a.out

Enter the domain limits a and b: 0 10
Enter the power p: 2
Value of the integral = 13.409283

$ ./a.out

Enter the domain limits a and b: 0 1
Enter the power p: 5
Value of the integral = 2.871176

$ ./a.out

Enter the domain limits a and b: 0 10
Enter the power p: 5
Value of the integral = 14.672927
