Largest exponent
Write a function that takes two natural numbers, x and n, as input,
computes the value of x raised to the power n, and returns that value to the caller function.
Use this function to determine and print the value of the largest integer n such that s^n < t,
where s and t are two natural numbers supplied by the user in main().

You cannot use any function from math library.


Examples:
Enter s and t: 2 25
Largest n = 4

Enter s and t: 3 25
Largest n = 2
