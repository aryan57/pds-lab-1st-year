Farthest random point
Write a program in which the main() takes as input the values of two integer variables (xm and ym), and for each integer j in [1,ym], generates a random number i in the interval [1,xm], and prints the point (i,j) on the terminal as "+".
In addition, the point C((int)(xm/2), (int)(ym/2)) should also be printed as "X".
Assume that a point (i,j) means line j and column i of the terminal.

While generating each point P(i,j), the main() has to call a function:
float farthest(int i, int j, float d), which will check whether P is farther from C w.r.t. the current farthest (by comparing the distance CP with the current farthest distance, d).
Accordingly, d will be updated and finally printed from main().
The coordinates of the farthest point should also be printed at the end.

You can use four global variables for storing the coordinates of C and those of the farthest point.

You also need to write and use an appropriate function print_point() to print C and each random point.
