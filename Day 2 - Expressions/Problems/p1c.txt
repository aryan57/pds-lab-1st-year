A particle starts from a point A(a,0) on x-axis with an initial speed u and moves along +x-axis with an acceleration alpha. Let d be its distance from the origin (0,0) after t seconds. Write a program to compute the value of d and print it on the terminal. The values of a, u, alpha, and t are real and supplied by the user during execution of your program.
