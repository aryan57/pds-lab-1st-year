TUTORIALS

t1a.
Write a program that takes as input the values of five floating-point variables (a, b, c, d, e) 
calculates the value of the expression ((a+b)*c)/d, 
stores the result in the variable e, 
and prints the value of e on the terminal. 
Assume that d is non-zero.

t1b.
Write a program that takes as input the (x,y) coordinates of two points p and q in floating point,
calculates the distance between p and q, and prints the result on the terminal.

Note: 
You should include math library for square root function as follows:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

Compilation command:
gcc p1b.c -lm

p1c.
A particle starts from a point A(a,0) on x-axis with an initial speed u and moves along +x-axis with an acceleration alpha. Let d be its distance from the origin (0,0) after t seconds. Write a program to compute the value of d and print it on the terminal. The values of a, u, alpha, and t are real and supplied by the user during execution of your program.
(The name of your C file should be p1c.c)

t1c.
User supplies a 2-digit number. 
Your program should print its digits and print the sum of these digits on the terminal.
