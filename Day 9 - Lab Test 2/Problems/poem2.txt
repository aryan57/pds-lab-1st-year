Sunshine beaming golden heat for lots of fun outdoors;
Vacations, for a sweet retreat to mountains, plains and shores.

Kids in constant summer motion, free from teacher's rule,
Head to toe in suntan lotion at the beach or pool.

Inflatable rafts on which to float, camping and fishing gear,
Rowing or sailing or water-ski boat, tell us summer's here.

Things we can't do the rest of the year are summer's special treasures;
Oh summer, summer, linger long, and give us all your pleasures!
