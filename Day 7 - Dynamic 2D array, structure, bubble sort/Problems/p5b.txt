Dynamic memory allocation and matrix multiplication
Your program has to compute the multiplication of two matrices a and b of dimensions m-by-n and n-by-p respectively.
For this, declare in main() three matrices: a, b, c.
Take as input the dimensions of a and b, and dynamically allocate the memory spaces for a, b, c.
Compute the product ab, store it in c, and print c on the terminal.
You should write as many functions as needed in order to make your code neat and easily comprehensible.
Assume that the elements of the matrices are integers.

Examples:

Enter #rows & #columns of 1st matrix: 1 1
Enter #columns of 2nd matrix: 1
Enter Matrix 1:
2
Enter Matrix 2:
3
Output matrix:
  6

Enter #rows & #columns of 1st matrix: 1 3
Enter #columns of 2nd matrix: 1
Enter Matrix 1:
3 5 7
Enter Matrix 2:
1
0
-1
Output matrix:
 -4

Enter #rows & #columns of 1st matrix: 3 5
Enter #columns of 2nd matrix: 2
Enter Matrix 1:
1 0 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 1
0 0 1 1 0
Enter Matrix 2:
2 1
3 5
1 0
2 3
1 4
Output matrix:
  5   4
  6  10
  3   3
