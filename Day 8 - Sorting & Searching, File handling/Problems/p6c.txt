p6c
Random disc drawing
Draw n (= user input, max 150) black discs with random centers and of radius 19 each in an image file named p6c.pbm.
The image height and width should be 401 and 601 respectively.
All discs should lie within the image.

Note:

A point belongs to a disk if the square of its distance from the disk-center is at most r2+r.
You can refer to p3c.c for random point generation.
Examples:

p6c-n10-seed1.pbm
p6c-n10-seed2.pbm
p6c-n50-seed1.pbm
p6c-n50-seed2.pbm
p6c-n150-seed1.pbm
