p6b
File reading + writing, dynamic memory allocation, and matrix multiplication
Your program has to compute the multiplication of two matrices A and B of dimensions m-by-n and n-by-p respectively.
The matrices A and B are available as mat1.txt and mat2.txt.
Read as input the dimensions of A and B, and dynamically allocate the memory spaces for A, B, C.
Compute the product AB, store it in C, and write C into mat3.txt.
You should write as many functions as needed in order to make your code neat and easily comprehensible.
Assume that the elements of the matrices are integers.

Note: You can use and modify your last-day code p5b.c to do this.

Example:
./a.out 
Input Matrix 1:
  3   1   0  -1   2  -1   0
  0  -1  -3   0   1  -2   1
  1  -2   2  -1   0  -3   0
  2  -5   1   3   0   0   1
 -1   0   1  -1   0   2  -1

Input Matrix 2:
 2 -1  0
-1  3  0
 1 -1  0
-2 -1  0
 0 -2  1
 1 -3  0
 1  0  1

Product Matrix:
  6   0   2
 -3   4   2
  5   1   0
  5 -21   1
  2  -5  -1
