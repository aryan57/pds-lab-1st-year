p2b (Leap year).
Given a year as input, your program should print whether it is a leap year. You can use if, else-if, etc. in your program.
(The name of your C file should be p2b.c)

Note: A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100.
However, if it is divisible by 400, then also it is a leap year.

$ ./a.out
Enter the year: 2018
Year 2018 is not a leap year.

$ ./a.out
