p2a (Triangle inequality).
User gives as input three positive real numbers.
Write a program to check whether they satisfy triangle inequality.
If not, print the reason on the terminal.
Otherwise, compute the three angles of the resultant triangle and
print their values in degree on the terminal.
(Use the cosine rule: a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2b.c.cos A)
(The name of your C file should be p2a.c)

Examples:

Enter three numbers: 3 4 5
Angles (in degree):  36.87,  53.13,  90.00

Enter three numbers: 3 4 8
Triangle not possible, as 3.000000 + 4.000000 <= 8.000000
