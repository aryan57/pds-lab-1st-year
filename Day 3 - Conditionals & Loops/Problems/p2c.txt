p2c (Quadratic equation).
Write a program to find the real or complex roots of ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a, b, c are real and given as input by the user.
(The name of your C file should be p2c.c)

Enter a, b, c in order: 1 2 3
Complex roots = -1.00+1.41i, -1.00-1.41i

Enter a, b, c in order: 1 3 2
Real roots = -1.00, -2.00

Enter a, b, c in order: 1 0 2
Complex roots = -0.00+1.41i, -0.00-1.41i

Enter a, b, c in order: 1 0 -2
Real roots = 1.41, -1.41
