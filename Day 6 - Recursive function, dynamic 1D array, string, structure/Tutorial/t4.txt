1. nCr for all r using recursion.
2. Uppercase conversion: Write a function toUpper(...) that converts an input string S (of length at most 100) to another string T (of same length) made of the uppercase characters corresponding to the characters in S. (Here a string may contain any keyboard character including whitespace.
     
Example


Enter string s:	Mr. & Mrs. Singh,  Delhi    102030

4. Word search in a dynamically allocated array: Declare a pointer to an array a[] of n tuples, each tuple having a roll number (int) and a name (20 chars max). Take the value of n as input and allocate the space for a[]. Fill up a[]. Search for a name (input) in a[] and print the result.
